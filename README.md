# Wordle-Clone
I created a clone of the Wordle game from NewYorkTimes. Credit goes to them for designing the game. I used CSS grid to style the tiles in a 5 by 6 grid. When a word is typed, the tiles fill up with that word and when the enter key is pressed, the tiles fill with a certain color based on whether that letter is in the answer, in the correct spot, or not in the answer.
